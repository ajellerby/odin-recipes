        <p>This recipe is for bbq ribs made on the grill</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 pounds pork spareribs</li>
            <li>1 cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>½ cup chile sauce</li>
            <li>¼ cup ketchup</li>
            <li>¼ cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>¼ cup Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>¼ cup rum</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dry mustard</li>
            <li>1 dash ground black pepper</li>
            <li>cooking spray</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Cut spareribs into serving size portions; wrap in double thickness of foil.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 1 1/2 hours. Unwrap and drain drippings. (I usually freeze drippings to use later in soups.) Place ribs in a large roasting pan.</li>
            <li>Mix together brown sugar, chile sauce, ketchup, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, rum, garlic, mustard, and pepper in a bowl. Coat ribs with sauce and marinate at room temperature for 1 hour or refrigerate for 8 hours to overnight.</li>
            <li>Preheat the grill to medium heat. Position grate 4 inches above heat source; grease the grate with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Cook ribs on the preheated grill for 30 minutes, basting with marinade.</li>
        </ol>
