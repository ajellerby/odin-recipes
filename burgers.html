            <li>2 pounds lean ground beef</li>
            <li>½ pound bulk Italian sausage</li>
            <li>½ large red onion, chopped</li>
            <li>2 Anaheim chile peppers, chopped</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>

          <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate.</li>
          <li>Mix the ground beef, sausage, onion, chile pepper, garlic, Muenster cheese, egg, Worcestershire sauce, and chili powder in a mixing bowl until evenly combined. Season to taste with salt and pepper and mix again. Form the meat mixture into 8 patties.</li>
